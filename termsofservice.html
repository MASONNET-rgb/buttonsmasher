    <h2>Short summary</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Button Smasher mobile application ("App") provided by Button Smasher ("we", "us", "our"). By installing, accessing, or using the App you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>By using the App you represent that you are at least the minimum age required in your jurisdiction to form a binding contract (commonly 13 or older) or that you have the consent of a parent or guardian. If you are accessing the App on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Account registration</h2>
    <p>Some features require account creation. When you register you must provide accurate information including a username and an email address. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.</p>

    <h2>User conduct and prohibited uses</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the App to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Violate any applicable law or regulation;</li>
      <li>Infringe the rights of others, including privacy or intellectual property rights;</li>
      <li>Transmit spam, malware, or other harmful code;</li>
      <li>Harass, threaten, or harm other users; or</li>
      <li>Attempt to interfere with or circumvent App security or monitoring mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of content you submit through the App. By submitting content you grant Button Smasher a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, host, and display that content in connection with providing the App and related services. We may remove or refuse to display any content that violates these Terms or applicable law.</p>

    <h2>Third-party services</h2>
    <p>The App may integrate with third-party services (for example, email delivery providers). Your use of those services is subject to the third parties' terms and privacy practices. We are not responsible for third-party content, policies, or practices.</p>

    <h2>Payment and fees</h2>
    <p>The App does not require payment by default. If paid features are added in the future, those features will be described separately and you will be required to agree to applicable payment terms before purchase.</p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our collection and use of personal information is described in the separate Privacy Policy available at the same domain as this Terms page. By using the App you agree to the Privacy Policy. Contact: <a href="mailto:masonnet@masonnet.org">masonnet@masonnet.org</a>.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Button Smasher disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Button Smasher be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to your use of the App. Our aggregate liability for direct damages is limited to the greater of $50 or any amount you paid to Button Smasher in the 12 months prior to the claim (if any).</p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Button Smasher and its officers, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses arising from your breach of these Terms or your use of the App.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time for violation of these Terms or for operational or security reasons. You may delete your account at any time by following the in-app deletion process or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:masonnet@masonnet.org">masonnet@masonnet.org</a>. Upon termination we will delete your account data as described in our Privacy Policy except where retention is required by law.</p>

    <h2>Governing law and disputes</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the state or country where Button Smasher is established, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. To the extent permitted by law, disputes will be resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction.</p>

    <h2>Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes we will post the revised Terms and update the effective date above. Continued use of the App after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>Entire agreement</h2>
    <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices posted by Button Smasher, constitute the entire agreement between you and Button Smasher regarding the App.</p>
