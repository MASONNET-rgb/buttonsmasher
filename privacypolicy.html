    <h2>Short summary</h2>
    <p>Button Smasher collects the minimum personal data required to provide account functionality. This page explains what data we collect, why, how we use it, how long we keep it, with whom we share it, and how to contact us.</p>

    <h2>Data Controller</h2>
    <p>Controller: Button Smasher (the developer/publisher of the Button Smasher app). Contact: <a href="mailto:masonnet@masonnet.org">masonnet@masonnet.org</a>.</p>

    <h2>What information we collect</h2>
    <p>We only collect the following information when you create an account in the app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Username</strong> — chosen display name used within the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong> — used for account verification, authentication, and account-related notifications (password reset, security alerts).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect or process other personal data (for example: contacts, precise location, device identifiers, payment information, or usage analytics) unless you explicitly provide it in a support message or other voluntary communication.</p>

    <h2>How we use the information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To create and maintain your account and enable login.</li>
      <li>To send account-related communications such as verification emails, password resets, and security notifications.</li>
      <li>To prevent abuse and to troubleshoot and support the service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal basis for processing (if applicable)</h2>
    <p>Where applicable, our lawful bases for processing are: performance of a contract (to provide the account and related features) and our legitimate interests (to secure the service and prevent abuse). For users in jurisdictions that require another legal basis, we will handle requests accordingly when contacted.</p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>We retain account information (username and email) for as long as your account exists. If you request account deletion, we will remove your personal data within a reasonable time frame, except where retention is required by law or for legitimate business reasons (e.g., to preserve evidence of abuse).</p>

    <h2>Data sharing and third parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent personal information to third parties. We may share the minimum necessary account data with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (for example, email delivery providers or identity verification services). We require such providers to process data only on our instructions and to maintain appropriate security controls.</p>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>Your account data may be processed or stored in countries outside your own. When transferring data internationally, we implement appropriate safeguards as required by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, including access controls and encryption where appropriate. No system can be guaranteed fully secure; in the event of a security incident affecting your personal data, we will comply with applicable breach-notification laws.</p>

    <h2>Target audience and children</h2>
    <p>Button Smasher is intended for all age groups, including adults and minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, or if a parent or guardian asks us to delete such data, we will promptly delete the information upon receipt of a valid request sent to <a href="mailto:masonnet@masonnet.org">masonnet@masonnet.org</a>.</p>

    <h2>Advertising and analytics</h2>
    <p>Button Smasher does not use advertising or collect analytics data by default. If we add analytics or advertising in the future, this policy will be updated and you will be informed of the change.</p>

    <h2>Choices and access</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access and correction</strong> — You can request access to or correction of your account information by contacting us.</li>
      <li><strong>Account deletion</strong> — You may request deletion of your account and associated personal data by contacting us at the address below. We will honor valid requests subject to legal requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing</strong> — We do not send marketing emails unless you explicitly opt in. You can opt out at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to contact us</h2>
    <p>For questions, requests to access, correct, or delete your data, or other privacy concerns, contact: <a href="mailto:masonnet@masonnet.org">masonnet@masonnet.org</a>.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. When we make material changes, we will update the effective date shown at the top of this page and, where required, notify you by email or in-app notice.</p>
